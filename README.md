## What is the Scaler September Open Source Challenge?
Every day throughout September, for those who have enrolled, we will share one task. 
Participants will need to use their knowledge of Git and Github for each task, and the difficulty level of the tasks will rise daily.

The primary objective? To help the community become better at contributing to open source and building projects.

## Learning Outcomes
1. Learn how to contribute to open source projects. Learn the basics of creating issues, pull requests, Git and Github
2. Celebrate with new rewards every time you reach a milestone!

## Prizes
Consistency is what we're after. As a result, we have several levels or awards based on how consistently you complete the assignments.
You won't be qualified for the remaining tasks of the challenge if you are unable to complete and submit a task on any given day.

Here is the reward [tier list](https://scalerdiscord.notion.site/3eabe9a1900c4b8685ae55acb5c33cbe?v=001e8d4c287f4d96bae935c5d45de521).
